## File Uploading Project

   by Rain and Tomson


## Use Instruction
use
```sh
npm install
```
before starting the nodejs server because we use other dependencies apart from mime and socket.io
then use 
```sh
node app.js
```
to start the nodejs server. Then visit the site via port 3456


## Creative Portion
We added a function to transfer the Administrator privilege to other people. 
We also give a functionality to use emoji within the text.
If you want to use the emoji, type :) for ðŸ˜ƒ, -- for ðŸ˜…, :( for ðŸ™ƒ, :D for ðŸ˜Š, :X for ðŸ˜µ
For example, you can type "hello :)" (a space between 'hello' and ':)') for helloðŸ˜ƒ
